We have developed an advanced wave energy converter that enables highly reliable conversion of sea and ocean waves into electrical power in an extremely cost effective way. The installation is based on an easy drop & connect principle and in extreme wave conditions the wave energy converter will self protect.

The Dutch Wave Power technology consists of a floating body containing all the energy conversion components, completely sealed off from the salty seawater. The floating body moves along with the rotating movement of the waves. This rotation is used to generate renewable energy.

More revelations coming soon!
