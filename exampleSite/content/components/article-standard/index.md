## What does it do?
This component takes the page content and presents it for reading purposes.
This will be presented in a standard single column with a maximum width.

## What can you customize?
Like all components, you can customize the appearance, setting background color, background image, overlay texture, parallax effect and item background color.

Because it presents the Main Content, you can use markdown with our shortcodes to present your content as you like.
We ship Poppygo One with some advanced shortcodes. Take for example the "image" shortcode. This shortcode takes care of all image formats and processes them into optimized images for all screens. Next to this you can determine the width, alignment and let the text flow next to the image.
